#Conjugate gradient and FFT links

= Introduction =

DDSCAT uses several numerical techniques. Among them conjugate gradient methods and FFT are the most important. Google code conjugate gradient page maintained by us is available

http://code.google.com/p/conjugate-gradient-lib/

it provides access to several conjugate gradient packages and codes which we tested in the past.
